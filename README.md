## Readme

SlugIOT is a remote device management system for small embedded linux systems.

This is the version of code that runs on the client.  
Install it in the home directory, when logged in as user pi.
    
    cd /home/pi
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/slugiot/slugiot-client.git

The --recursive option is important, or else you will be missing PyDAL, the database abstraction layer. 

## Running the code on client

The installation scripts can be found in the installation directory.

Note: if you need to access the client admin area (recommended), then you 
will first need to enable ssl on the device using these or similar commands:
    
    cd /home/pi/slugiot-client
    sudo openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
    sudo openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
    sudo openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

You must then also uncomment the following parameters: '-c server.crt -k server.key'
in the do_startup code block in slugiot_startup.sh prior to running slugiot_install.sh

The script slugiot_install.sh enters the startup script into the server initialization.

    cd installation
    sh ./slugiot_install.sh
    
The startup script (which it runs) safely starts the webserver and queues the 
sync tasks in scheduler.  The script currently works for Raspberry Pi; you 
need to change the location of the code if you install the code on other architectures. 

The startup scripts also create a ram disk, mounted at /ramfs. 
You need this ram disk in order to run SlugIOT client: a short-term database is created
in /ramfs/storage.sqlite. 

## Running the code in test mode

To run the code in test mode, there are two ways. 

### Running in testing mode

In this mode, SlugIOT does not rely on a RAM file system (you might be running this on
your laptop after all).  Run it from terminal as follows (Note: scheduler run 
as separate process due to iOS/PyCharm bug):

    SLUGIOT_TESTING='y'
    export SLUGIOT_TESTING
    python web2py.py -e -p 8600 -i 0.0.0.0 -K client -X 
    
where 8600 is the port at which the process should be running (feel free to change it).  
To avoid bug that causes Python to crash, do not set password so that gui will launch (specify
it there) instead of command line.  Once it is up and running, inject a job in the scheduler via:

    curl http://localhost:8600/startup/_startup.html

### Running in production mode

If you have been testing on the same machine, remember to do

    SLUGIOT_TESTING='n'
    export SLUGIOT_TESTING
    
Then, start SlugIOT via:

    sudo sh /etc/init.d/slugiot_startup restart

Note: The default server host address is for localhost, as defined in the 
appconfig.ini file.  In production this address will likely need to be changed
since the server is not meant to be run on the client device.

    cd ~
    nano ./slugiot-client/applications/client/private/appconfig.ini

Enter in the domain name for the server or the server ip from inet shown
for en0 in display from running 'ifconfig' on server.
